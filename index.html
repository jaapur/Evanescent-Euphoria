  <b>Intro (Early Life)</b>
<p>Jasper Eckert started piano lessons at the age of 7, began drumming in bands at 9, learned saxophone at 11, started to produce and DJ at 13, played the marching snare at 14, and sang as a tenor at 16. Soon after that he began rapping, and experimenting with all of the delineations thereafter. During his life, he’s picked up on the intricate ins and outs of the creative and technical processes that it takes to make a song. At the age of 13, Jasper discovered the world of music production. He soon found audio engineering to be a perfect pair with its post-production counterpart. Diversifying his soundscape and genre spectrum was, is, and always will be a goal he’s had set out. Having 26 projects on Bandcamp since 2011, they outline his path through learning what it is he knows about music creation and expression. In 2017, he decided to continue the journey through Distrokid which allowed him to finally be on popular streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Youtube and more.</p>

<b>Development</b>
<p>Jasper has worked closely with numerous peers who also involve themselves deeply in the local music scene of Corvallis. Ranging from old school rappers to post-punk trap pop, to instrumental 90’s revival synthpop and future dubstep remixes of Mo Bamba by SheckWes, there hasn’t been much to come Jasper’s way that hes turned down. Even doing sound gigs at house venues or local bars and DJing themed nightclubs, there’s always one common denominator: making music happen.</p>

<b>23rd Street Records</b>
<p>Despite the passion of music being unstoppable, there are other elements to being a successful artist that require just as much focus with much less of the satisfaction. Nobody can do everything at the same time. In 2018, an opportunity was presented to Jasper. He agreed to be a part of a two person remix competition for the local Oregon State University media class. Orange Media students greeted Jasper and Josh Hiwatashi (Spacey) as they met for the first time, to be battling against each other in production skills and trivia. From that interaction, Jasper found out that Josh was a producer and so came the invitation that would spark a flame bigger than anyone expected. When Jasper asked Josh to join him and company at Griffins house for a studio session in early spring the next year, Griffin and Josh quickly realized they had a class together. At the time, Jasper was only just introduced to the record label that Griffin Spurr and the original founders had only barely started. After a few shows were under Spurr MMPA’s belt, Jasper became non-contractually signed to, at the time, Griffin Spurr’s Spurr Music Management and Promotion Agency. As Jasper was already quite tapped into the local scene, he saw a way to take Griffins startup to the next level by hitting the bar scene and going public with the events. As he proved his leadership, Jasper was promoted to President not long after joining the label in early 2019. With 7 artists on the team at the time, the name was becoming less and less appealing to all. From a unanimous vote, the company decided to incorporate Spaceys major release 23rd Street Vol. 1 into the overall image and aesthetic of the label and name it 23rd Street Records (23streetrecords.com). Having that major change out of the way, the label had time to focus on creating once again and in the spring of 2020, multiple albums surfaced as the growing collective of artists prepared for their summer releases.</p>

<b>Professional Life</b>
	<p>Being a professional DJ is a funny title because you can have a great month making a few thousand dollars and then make absolutely nothing the next month.  Jasper has not been making thousands each month from DJing, however he has definitely experienced the ups and downs of having an okay night at the club versus a great night, or a summer with four weddings versus a summer with none. Jasper has always involved himself in the gig trade, almost exclusively except for a few jobs. Jasper worked at Papa Murphy’s for a year and a half, the worst year and a half of his life. After getting fired for not being committed to the team in 2017, he began to get a little more serious with a social media venture his friend Geebzer introduced him to. Although he would live-stream for hours on numerous mobile apps on and off throughout the course of three years, he would never make more than $600 throughout his mobile streaming career. Initially, it resulted in an upsurge of instagram followers as his first experience with mobile live-streaming was catapulted by Geebzer’s already at the time skyrocketing career. Once Jasper realized that a few months of live-streaming wouldn’t fix his unemployment issue, he began searching for jobs again. Landing in the physical labor realm of the work-force, he found himself part-time landscaping and part-time house painting. House painting would carry on longer and become almost full time until June 2019. During the summer that he picked up these labor jobs, Jasper was also taking classes at Sprout City Studios in Eugene with his friend Zach Stevens. They were training to be in-house engineers for what was the nicest studio either of them had ever seen before. Once they completed the classes in late summer of 2018, they were granted keys and full access to the studio. Resulting in higher prices due to the quality increase, Jasper would still frequently do cheaper bedroom studio sessions as well. On June 7th, 2019, Jasper crashed his car, breaking his back. He has been unemployed since, however remains independently working on a music career.</p>

<b>Aspirations</b>
	<p>For years, there has been a vision of a fully analog, no VST plugin, no auto-tune indie rock album for Jasper. Realistically, he knows that it’s only a matter of time before the resources present themselves and the music will be born. With a direct approach and unbiased opinions, he is aiming to not only create the best music he’s ever made, but also the best that he can for the people he works with.. As technology advances and we learn more, there is always room for improvement and history is here to document the process.</p>

  <b>What is Evanescent Euphoria?</b>
<p>Euphoria is the most sensual positive emotion. You feel euphoria more than any other feeling. But is anything forever? To evanesce. I will, my feelings will, everything will. </p>
